## Overview

SARIS consists of **10 specialized modules** that provide advanced map visualization, live data integration, and tactical planning for emergency services. The plugin is designed for quick operation during high-pressure scenarios, making critical information accessible with minimal effort.

### Key Modules

1. **ARSO Radar Viewer**
   - Displays animated radar images.
   - Users can select layer types such as **rain, wind, temperature**, and more.
   - Built-in animation player for historical and current radar data.

2. **Layer Selector (Izbirnik slojev)**
   - Access **40+ data layers** and **20 map layers**.
   - One-click visualization of roads, police/fire stations, hydrants, and more.
   - Simplifies overlay management for emergency mapping.

3. **Live Data Modules**
   - **Road Cameras:** View live feeds from traffic cameras.
   - **Weather Stations:** Real-time weather data visualization.
   - **Firefighter Locations & Vehicles:** Track teams and ongoing interventions.
   - **Intervention Sectors:** Map areas of current and planned operations.

4. **Dispatch Central Integration**
   - Connects to Motorola DMR radio system.
   - Displays radio station locations and telemetry in a dockable list view.

5. **Drone Telemetry Integration**
   - Connected to [Sokol](https://github.com/lbttim/Sokol) for live drone data.
   - Shows drone positions, flight paths, and telemetry directly on the map.

6. **SITAC Editor (SITAC Urejevalnik)**
   - Tactical planning editor for firefighting operations.
   - Uses **CEN CWA 18017** graphics standard.
   - Optimized for quick, intuitive drawing during emergencies.

7. **Location Info (Lokacija INFO)**
   - Right-click on any map location to get detailed data:
     - Coordinates and address
     - Building information (floors, apartments, height, construction type)
     - Local firefighting and police units
     - Fire plans if available
     - Nearby objects: hydrants, gas connections, and other key infrastructure
